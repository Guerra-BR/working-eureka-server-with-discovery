This is a code that took me a while to get working again, I saw the difficulty of many who were unable to make the Eureka-Server and Registrartion and Discovery functions work. I spent a lot of time getting it to work, and now that I've done it, I'm sharing the working code

eureka-config-server: The Eureka server itself

admin-service: A Client that makes a GET request on a product-service

product-service: A Client that is able to receive the request




I will bring future updates for a more complex network, but the necessary configuration is all ready.
Make use of
